## Overview

Welcome to AIMSEngine, an open-source Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS) designed to help enterprises map, govern, measure, and monitor deployed AI across their organization. AIMSEngine is built with the aim of conforming to the NIST AI standards, ensuring that AI is run in a trustworthy, secure, and transparent manner.

### Why AIMSEngine?

As AI systems become increasingly integrated into business processes, the need for robust management frameworks is paramount. AIMSEngine addresses this need by offering a comprehensive platform that provides a Single Pane of Glass for AI governance and beyond. While AI unlocks numerous opportunities, it also introduces significant risks. AIMSEngine steps in to bridge the growing gap in AI protection, offering essential safeguards where they're most needed.

To facilitate multi-stakeholder collaboration, organizations need a unified dashboard that enables them to assess, monitor, and take timely actions. As new regulations continue to emerge rapidly, it's crucial for the platform to support geo- and industry-specific regulations, ensuring due diligence is maintained from the outset (even before an AI project begins) and throughout its entire lifecycle. AIMSEngine is designed to integrate seamlessly with an organization's existing governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems, as well as enterprise risk management (ERM) solutions.

This platform is not just about ensuring that AI systems are compliant and transparent; it also extends to critical post-production aspects like continuous monitoring, performance tracking, and rapid issue resolution. The Map and Governance components will record data from auditors and certifiers of AI models before they are deployed, whether those models are developed in-house or integrated from third-party applications. AIMSEngine will focus on the control aspects of the NIST AI framework, ensuring that the escalation process for identifying and remediating AI alarms and risks is clearly defined and effectively managed.

AIMSEngine also emphasizes managing risk effectively, which is crucial for protecting your bottom line. By proactively identifying potential issues, minimizing the mean time to identification, and orchestrating swift restoration processes, AIMSEngine helps enterprises reduce operational disruptions and avoid costly failures. This ensures that AI remains a reliable asset, driving business value rather than introducing unforeseen risks.

### Key Features

- **Map AI Deployments:** Visualize and understand where AI is deployed within your organization. AIMSEngine offers detailed mapping tools that provide a clear overview of AI usage across different departments and processes.
  
- **Govern AI Operations:** Ensure that your AI systems adhere to internal policies and external regulations. AIMSEngine supports the establishment of rules, standards, and compliance measures in line with the NIST AI standards.

- **Measure AI Performance:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of your AI systems. AIMSEngine provides real-time monitoring and reporting to help you stay on top of AI performance.

- **Monitor AI Health:** Keep an eye on the operational health of your AI systems. AIMSEngine includes tools for syslog collection, alarm collection, and performance monitoring, enabling quick detection and escalation of issues.

### Architecture

AIMSEngine is built on a layered architecture to ensure flexibility, scalability, and reliability:

1. **Customer-Facing Layer:** This layer includes tools for mapping, governing, measuring, and monitoring AI systems. It provides the interface through which users interact with the platform.

2. **Core Layer:** The core layer handles the heavy lifting, including rules enforcement, standards compliance, KPI tracking, anomaly impact assessment, remediation, orchestration and scheduling.

3. **AI-Facing Layer:** This layer deals directly with AI systems, handling syslog collection, alarm collection, performance data, and AI model metadata. It ensures that the platform is closely integrated with the AI systems it manages.

### Why Conform to NIST AI Standards?

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a comprehensive framework for AI governance, focusing on trustworthiness, accountability, and transparency. By conforming to NIST AI standards, AIMSEngine ensures that AI systems are developed, deployed, and managed in a manner that is ethical, secure, and reliable.

### Get Involved
